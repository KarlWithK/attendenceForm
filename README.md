# Attendance Form
A python script to automatically filled out the attendance form

do:
> pip install --user -r requirements.txt

Uncomment and modify the file form.py at then end and putting inputs in fill_form() with your username and password in quotes.

or

python -i form.py
> fill_form(user name, pass)

If you have chrome switch start_firefox() for start_chrome. Only two supported browsers.

Planning to make it a background process that runs every day at 8:30, just waiting to see if the form is always the same
